#### _A Story of the Diabolical Doctor Shelly_
![DisassemblyLine_Intro_Preview.png](///raw/4ed/c4/z/54f03.png)

In this tongue-in-cheek endless horror game **extract as many organs as you can** deep within a questionable lab filled with conveyer belts and mysterious bodies. Time ticks away in your pursuit to provide the basic building blocks of the overseer’s monstrous creations – **brains, hearts, lungs and kidneys.** Constructing the ultimate abomination requires lots of fleshy essentials, so use the **color-coded tools** to deposit fresh meat before the heartless Dr. Shelly (do they even have a degree?) snaps and harvests **you** instead!

#### Controls

- **Deposit** organs in the **top right chute**.

#### Tips
- Only **one tool** and **one organ** can be carried at once.
- Organs **decay over time**, so discover and prioritize their value before it’s too late!
- Suspicious bodies are often damaged, so mix and match tools to **randomized cadavers**.
- Dr. Shelly is **never** placated.
